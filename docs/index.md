Welcome to the Remote Control Server. This project is intended to provide a simple way of running commands remotely without the need to open an ssh tunnel. There are bound to be more sphisticated ways of doing this, but at least this project was a good opportunity to look into [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com).

## Getting started

Have a look at the [quickstart guide](quickstart.md) to dip your toes into the water. Afterwards you can find out in the more extensive [example](example.md) how you can handle permissions for the commands to run.
